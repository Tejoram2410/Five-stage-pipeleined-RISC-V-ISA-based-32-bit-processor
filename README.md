# RV32I Pipelined RISC-V Microprocessor

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project was to design and implement a **RISC-V pipelined microprocessor** that supports the full **RV32I instruction set**, using Verilog HDL. This includes all base integer instructions defined under RV32I, with the exception of `SRAI`.

We started with a basic single-cycle implementation to ensure correctness, and then transitioned to a pipelined architecture to improve performance and throughput.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Approach

### Phase 1: Single-Cycle Processor

Our first milestone was building a working single-cycle processor that could execute one instruction per clock cycle. This version helped us verify that each module and instruction behaved as expected in isolation.

### Phase 2: 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

Once the single-cycle processor was stable, we redesigned the architecture using the classic **5-stage pipeline**:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execute (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

To handle pipeline hazards, we designed a **Hazard Unit** that includes:
- Load-use hazard detection and stalling
- Forwarding logic to resolve data hazards efficiently without unnecessary stalls
- Control hazard detection for branch and jump instructions

## üîß Processor Components

Here's a quick rundown of the key modules in the design:

- **Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU):** Fetches instructions based on the current PC value.
- **Instruction Memory:** Stores the program and outputs a 32-bit instruction based on the PC.
- **Register File:** 32 general-purpose registers, each 32 bits wide, supporting 2 reads and 1 write per cycle.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic and logic operations based on control signals.
- **Control Unit:** Decodes instructions and generates control signals for the datapath.
- **Immediate Generator:** Extracts and sign-extends immediate values for different instruction formats.
- **Data Memory:** Used for `LW` and `SW` instructions, handling 32-bit word reads and writes.
- **Hazard Unit (with Forwarding):** Detects hazards and applies forwarding to minimize pipeline stalls.
- **Pipeline Registers:** Store values and control signals between pipeline stages to keep execution synchronized.

## ‚úÖ Supported Instructions (RV32I)

All RV32I instructions are supported **except** for `SRAI`. This includes:

### Arithmetic & Logical (Register)
- `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `SLL`, `SRL`, `SLT`, `SLTU`

### Arithmetic & Logical (Immediate)
- `ADDI`, `ANDI`, `ORI`, `XORI`, `SLLI`, `SRLI`, `SLTI`, `SLTIU`

### Memory Instructions
- `LW` (Load Word)  
- `SW` (Store Word)

### Control Flow Instructions
- `BEQ`, `BNE`, `BLT`, `BGE`, `BLTU`, `BGEU`
- `JAL` (Jump and Link)
- `JALR` (Jump and Link Register)

### Upper Immediate Instructions
- `LUI` (Load Upper Immediate)
- `AUIPC` (Add Upper Immediate to PC)

All instructions were tested through simulation using custom programs and verified using waveform analysis tools like ModelSim or GTKWave.

## üîç Testing & Simulation

- ‚úÖ Each instruction was validated with custom test programs
- ‚úÖ Pipeline behavior checked for RAW hazards, control hazards, and proper forwarding
- ‚úÖ Waveforms were inspected to ensure correct timing across pipeline stages
- ‚úÖ Hazard cases like load-use and branch delays were explicitly tested
