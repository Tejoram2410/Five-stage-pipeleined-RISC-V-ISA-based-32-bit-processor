# RV32I Pipelined RISC-V Microprocessor

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project was to design and implement a **RISC-V pipelined microprocessor** that supports the full **RV32I base instruction set**, using Verilog HDL. It was built from scratch to gain practical experience in processor design, with a focus on datapath control, pipelining, and hazard resolution.

We started with a working single-cycle processor to validate functionality, and then re-architected it as a pipelined processor to improve throughput and reflect real-world designs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Approach

### Phase 1: Single-Cycle Processor

The first version used a single-cycle design, where one instruction is executed per clock cycle. This helped us ensure each module worked correctly and every instruction behaved as expected.

### Phase 2: 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

To enhance performance, we transitioned to a **5-stage pipelined architecture**, consisting of:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execute (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

To handle pipeline hazards, we implemented a **Hazard Unit** that:
- Detects data hazards (especially load-use)
- Resolves hazards using internal **forwarding logic**
- Handles control hazards from branches and jumps

## üîß Processor Components

The processor includes the following Verilog modules:

- **Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU):** Fetches instructions based on the program counter (PC).
- **Instruction Memory:** Stores and returns 32-bit instructions.
- **Register File:** 32 general-purpose registers (32-bit), with dual read and single write support.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Handles arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals.
- **Control Unit:** Decodes opcodes and generates datapath control signals.
- **Immediate Generator:** Extracts and sign-extends immediates from instruction fields.
- **Data Memory:** Supports word-level load and store operations.
- **Hazard Unit (with Forwarding):** Handles both data and control hazards to maintain pipeline flow.
- **Pipeline Registers:** Carry data and control signals between stages.

## üîç Testing & Simulation

- Custom test programs were written to validate all instructions and pipeline behavior.
- Load-use, control hazard, and forwarding scenarios were tested in depth.
- All debugging and waveform inspections were carried out using **Vivado**.

Test Code:
his program multiplies **96 √ó 6** using pure **RV32I instructions**, without any multiply (`MUL`) instruction or pseudo-instructions. It stores the values in memory and performs multiplication using a loop with repeated addition.

### üìÑ Description

- **Input values:**
  - 96 stored at memory address `0x00`
  - 6 stored at memory address `0x04`
- **Result:**
  - Stored at memory address `0x08`

The code multiplies these numbers by repeatedly adding 96 a total of 6 times.

### üß† How it Works

```assembly
    .text
    .globl _start

_start:
    # Base address = 0x00000000
    addi    t0, x0, 0       # t0 = base address

    # Store 69 to mem[0]
    addi    t1, x0, 96      # t1 = 69
    sw      t1, 0(t0)       # mem[0] = 69

    # Store 96 to mem[4]
    addi    t1, x0, 6      # t1 = 96
    sw      t1, 4(t0)       # mem[4] = 96

    # Load num1 and num2 from memory
    lw      t1, 0(t0)       # t1 = num1 = 69
    lw      t2, 4(t0)       # t2 = num2 = 96

    # Initialize result and counter
    addi    t3, x0, 0       # t3 = result = 0
    addi    t4, x0, 0       # t4 = counter = 0

loop:
    beq     t4, t2, end     # if counter == num2, break
    add     t3, t3, t1      # result += num1
    addi    t4, t4, 1       # counter++
    jal     x0, loop        # jump back to loop

end:
    sw      t3, 8(t0)       # store result at mem[8]

hang:
    jal     x0, hang        # infinite loop to end program
