# RV32I Pipelined RISC-V Microprocessor

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project was to design and implement a **RISC-V pipelined microprocessor** that supports the full **RV32I base instruction set**, using Verilog HDL. It was built from scratch to gain practical experience in processor design, with a focus on datapath control, pipelining, and hazard resolution.

We started with a working single-cycle processor to validate functionality, and then re-architected it as a pipelined processor to improve throughput and reflect real-world designs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Approach

### Phase 1: Single-Cycle Processor

The first version used a single-cycle design, where one instruction is executed per clock cycle. This helped us ensure each module worked correctly and every instruction behaved as expected.

### Phase 2: 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

To enhance performance, we transitioned to a **5-stage pipelined architecture**, consisting of:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execute (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**

To handle pipeline hazards, we implemented a **Hazard Unit** that:
- Detects data hazards (especially load-use)
- Resolves hazards using internal **forwarding logic**
- Handles control hazards from branches and jumps

## üîß Processor Components

The processor includes the following Verilog modules:

- **Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU):** Fetches instructions based on the program counter (PC).
- **Instruction Memory:** Stores and returns 32-bit instructions.
- **Register File:** 32 general-purpose registers (32-bit), with dual read and single write support.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Handles arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals.
- **Control Unit:** Decodes opcodes and generates datapath control signals.
- **Immediate Generator:** Extracts and sign-extends immediates from instruction fields.
- **Data Memory:** Supports word-level load and store operations.
- **Hazard Unit (with Forwarding):** Handles both data and control hazards to maintain pipeline flow.
- **Pipeline Registers:** Carry data and control signals between stages.
